(2, 'How to programming with Java', 'ibm.jpg', 'Java platform overview\r\nJava technology is used to develop applications for a wide range of environments, from consumer devices to heterogeneous enterprise systems. In this section, get a high-level view of the Java platform and its components.\r\n\r\nThe Java language\r\nGet to know the Java APIs\r\n\r\nMost Java developers constantly reference the official online Java API documentation— also called the Javadoc. By default, you see three panes in the Javadoc. The top-left pane shows all of the packages in the API, and the bottom-left pane shows the classes in each package. The main pane (to the right) shows details for the currently selected package or class. For example, if you click the java.util package in the top-left pane and then click the ArrayList class listed below it, you see details about ArrayList in the right pane, including a description of what it does, how to use it, and its methods.\r\n\r\nLike any programming language, the Java language has its own structure, syntax rules, and programming paradigm. The Java language\'s programming paradigm is based on the concept of OOP, which the language\'s features support.\r\n\r\nThe Java language is a C-language derivative, so its syntax rules look much like C\'s. For example, code blocks are modularized into methods and delimited by braces ({ and }), and variables are declared before they are used.\r\n\r\nStructurally, the Java language starts with packages. A package is the Java language\'s namespace mechanism. Within packages are classes, and within classes are methods, variables, constants, and more. You learn about the parts of the Java language in this tutorial.\r\n\r\nThe Java compiler\r\nWhen you program for the Java platform, you write source code in .java files and then compile them. The compiler checks your code against the language\'s syntax rules, then writes out bytecode in .class files. Bytecode is a set of instructions targeted to run on a Java virtual machine (JVM). In adding this level of abstraction, the Java compiler differs from other language compilers, which write out instructions suitable for the CPU chipset the program will run on.\r\n\r\nThe JVM\r\nAt runtime, the JVM reads and interprets .class files and executes the program\'s instructions on the native hardware platform for which the JVM was written. The JVM interprets the bytecode just as a CPU would interpret assembly-language instructions. The difference is that the JVM is a piece of software written specifically for a particular platform. The JVM is the heart of the Java language\'s \"write-once, run-anywhere\" principle. Your code can run on any chipset for which a suitable JVM implementation is available. JVMs are available for major platforms like Linux and Windows, and subsets of the Java language have been implemented in JVMs for mobile phones and hobbyist chips.\r\n\r\nThe garbage collector\r\nRather than forcing you to keep up with memory allocation (or use a third-party library to do so), the Java platform provides memory management out of the box. When your Java application creates an object instance at runtime, the JVM automatically allocates memory space for that object from the heap— a pool of memory set aside for your program to use. The Java garbage collector runs in the background, keeping track of which objects the application no longer needs and reclaiming memory from them. This approach to memory handling is called implicit memory management because it doesn\'t require you to write any memory-handling code. Garbage collection is one of the essential features of Java platform performance.\r\n\r\nThe Java Development Kit\r\nWhen you download a Java Development Kit (JDK), you get — in addition to the compiler and other tools — a complete class library of prebuilt utilities that help you accomplish most common application-development tasks. The best way to get an idea of the scope of the JDK packages and libraries is to check out the JDK API documentation.\r\n\r\nThe Java Runtime Environment\r\nThe Java Runtime Environment (JRE; also known as the Java runtime) includes the JVM, code libraries, and components that are necessary for running programs that are written in the Java language. The JRE is available for multiple platforms. You can freely redistribute the JRE with your applications, according to the terms of the JRE license, to give the application\'s users a platform on which to run your software. The JRE is included in the JDK.', 1, '2018-03-18 00:43:21', 520),
(4, `The Challenges Of Remaking A Classic Like Resident Evil 2', 'games_re2.jpg', 'We\'ve known about the Resident Evil 2 remake for a long time. Although it was announced in late 2015 by producer Yoshiaki \"H\" Hirabayashi, the survival horror remake was kept under wraps until E3 2018. During Sony\'s press conference, Capcom debuted the first gameplay trailer, finally giving us a glimpse at how it\'ll look and play. And better yet, we got a release date: January 29, 2019.\r\n\r\nThe excitement of seeing familiar characters and locales recreated with modern visuals was only elevated after our time spent playing a demo at E3. Resident Evil 2 Remake feels like it respects the nostalgia fans have for the game, and actually factors their intimate knowledge of the game into its design. It stokes memories of the PlayStation classic with faithful renditions of iconic Raccoon City locations, while at the same time unexpectedly flipping the script on the original to terrify longtime fans. While Resident Evil 2 Remake currently feels like a respectful cover of the original with some modern flourishes, our time spent in Racoon City left us with a few questions.\r\n\r\nDuring the show, GameSpot was given the opportunity to talk to Yoshiaki \"H\" Hirabayashi and Tsuyoshi Kanda, the producers of Resident Evil 2 Remake. We discussed not only how much the game has changed from the original, but other subjects such as why they chose to use a third-person over-the-shoulder view, how much Resident Evil 7 influenced the game\'s development, and their major inspirations while working on the project.\r\n\r\nGameSpot: How much of the game has changed? What can fans expect to be the same as the original and what they can expect to be completely different?\r\n\r\nH: It\'s hard to nail down a percentage of new versus old per se, but we really wanted to trace the original game, and that will let you have your muscle memory for keeping the key beats of how the game is structured. But in between those key beats, we wanted to do some restructuring and bring some new surprises. So you\'ll definitely have key moments which feel totally nostalgic and you\'re like, \"This is Resident Evil 2.\" But there will be some other parts in-between that [which] will actually be quite fresh and original.\r\n\r\nHow easy has it been for you in terms of creative freedom to reshape and reconfigure such an iconic game? How do you implement changes while retaining the spirit and mechanics of the original?\r\n\r\nNo Caption Provided\r\nTsuyoshi Kanda: I feel like we\'re a team who all really respect the original a lot, but we do feel our creative freedom coming out of the fact that we\'re using the RE engine, which was first used in Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, and being able to use that as the basis for the game has really unlocked a lot of freedom for us because it\'s such a great basis.\r\n\r\nYou know, it\'s let us achieve such amazing immersive visuals and sound that we are then free to focus on thinking about how we\'re going to restructure the game, and it lets us challenge ourselves to bring our best game to the process. So I would personally feel like it was quite a free process to this point.\r\n\r\nH: I feel like I\'ve gone back and forth a lot. You know, we see-sawed a lot between total respect/recreate the original, and then bring something new. Players today need something new to experience, and the team all have got their own individual memories of playing the original game and how they felt about it, and what they wanted to bring to the new project. And I think that over the course of the three or so years of development, what we\'ve arrived at is what people played at the show. It\'s hitting all the beats that you\'ll remember, but it\'s taking time to also bring you something fresh in between those.\r\n\r\nThere has obviously been great critical success with Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, but the remake was announced before its release. Did that game\'s success influence the direction of where you wanted to go with the Resident Evil 2 remake?\r\n\r\nKanda: Well, we first soft-announced this title in late 2015 with the We Do It video. At that time, Resident Evil 7 was already in development ... and then we went on to release it in January 2017. So the timeline has kind of been parallel for both games, but there\'s been a great positive effect on both titles from each other.\r\n\r\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017)\r\nResident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017)\r\nThe learning we have from that process have been able to be fit back into Resident Evil 2, because it\'s using the same engine, and that lets us bring a higher level of quality. While we are using the same tools, we [are] even better at using them now than we were with Resident Evil 7. Both titles have sort of similar approaches in that we want to bring the ultimate in horror and immersion to each of their different concepts, and I think that they\'ve been a positive influence on each other.\r\n\r\nHow did you settle on the perspective? The series has gone in numerous directions over the years, and with Resident Evil 7\'s camera being first-person, what made you choose third-person?\r\n\r\nH: We looked into all kinds of possibilities and options during a long process of deliberation and consideration when it came to the camera, and it all came down to the feeling we want you to have when you play the game, and we wanted to have the key pillars of scary survival horror, and also, a sort of so-called metroidvania style exploration of the environment. And when it came to how to bring the best experience of those two aspects together: the answer was the over-the-shoulder third-person view.\r\n\r\nWe wanted it to be intimately terrifying in nature, to [have] up-close and personal zombie encounters that you can only get, I think, with that kind of camera view. You\'ve got your character right on the screen, but when a zombie comes in and bites you...maybe you noticed on the demo there\'s like cinematic zoom in, and they just [get] right up in your face.\r\n\r\nIt\'s an intensely personal experience, and the only way to do that we felt was to choose this kind of camera angle. So it\'s really delivering the experience that we want players to have with this perspective.\r\n\r\nIt\'s also opened up the possibilities of the puzzles, which are a classic element of Resident Evil games. There\'s a room where, slightly ironically, there\'s remnants of welcome party set up for Leon\'s first day. It was supposed to be his first day, and it was supposed to be a celebration, and in that setting you find a note on the desk detailing what would have been a fun puzzle game if it wasn\'t for the zombie outbreak where his new colleagues were saying, \"We need you to remember our names. We\'re going to play a game,\" and you have to find all their name plates to unlock Leon\'s desk. And you find them scattered across other desks or some of them are dropped on the floor, but you really need to look for them and get up close to the environment.\r\n\r\nYou can only do that with a camera like that. If it\'s a super pulled-out camera, it can be very difficult to implement that kind of puzzle. So I think that this has also been a great choice for us to open up the possibilities of how we should bring you puzzle-solving and how we planned that in with exploration and combat.\r\n\r\nResident Evil 2 has a huge legacy. I know it has been much requested, but what motivated you to take on remaking Resident Evil 2? Why was this something you wanted to do?\r\n\r\nKanda: We really just want to give fans what they want, you know? We have this original game that\'s known as a masterpiece and it\'s been so many years and people have been saying that they\'d really like to revisit this title, and whenever that kind of intensity and passion from the fans is out there, it\'s impossible for us to ignore that really, because it\'s a sign of how dedicated they are to our titles and our brands.\r\n\r\nEveryone on the remake team is a Resident Evil 2 fan, so just as much as anyone, we want to make the amazing game that the fans want as well.\r\n\r\nYoshiaki \"H\" Hirabayashi\r\nIt almost becomes an inevitability at that point, so we just decided that we really want to take this on. You know, there\'s a process when you\'re deciding how to take on a game like this, I mean, a lot of trial and error and decisions to be made, but at the end of the day we just want to try and take the massive expectations that you have, which could be taken as a negative or a reason not to do it, but we want to take that and say, \"We\'re going to aim high. We\'re going to not only match that, we\'re going to exceed those expectations.\" It\'s a really exciting challenge for us.\r\n\r\nH: We are included in that group of fans of RE 2, ourselves. Everyone on the remake team is a Resident Evil 2 fan, so just as much as anyone, we want to make the amazing game that the fans want as well.\r\n\r\nHorror and action has been a tough balance Resident Evil has had to make over the years. How did you go about managing this for the Resident Evil 2 remake? What was your philosophy on this dynamic for this project?\r\n\r\nH: First, I want to make sure that everyone is aware right from the announcement period that just because we\'ve gone with over-the-shoulder third person, that it\'s not Resident Evil 4, you know? The ingredients for Resident Evil 4 was it\'s Resident Evil, it\'s over-the-shoulder, and it\'s bringing in shooter elements.\r\n\r\nNo Caption Provided\r\nBut this game isn\'t the same; we\'re taking the explorative elements--the Metroidvania-like backtracking exploration you\'ve seen in previous Resident Evil games--and we\'re putting in an over-the-shoulder perspective, but that\'s it. We\'re not actually adding in any of the extra shooter aspects that was a part of Resident Evil 4. So it isn\'t going to take on the tone and style of the more action hero approach you\'ve seen many of the characters take in previous Resident Evil games. It\'s still these average people stuck in the desperate situation, trying to survive.\r\n\r\nThe way we can make players feel powerful in that context is they\'re not just going to be reeling off endless rounds of bullets; they\'re going to have to do resource management and they\'re going to have to watch their ammo. If they\'re able to learn the best way to aim and shoot zombies, and how to take them down or weaken them; then there\'s the risk and reward of taking the time learn how to get the right shot.\r\n\r\nSo I think that even though you\'re not an action hero in this game, you\'re going to feel powerful by having learned exactly the timing and approach and strategy you need to take the enemies down.\r\n\r\nThat\'s actually something I noticed about the shooting mechanics. You really have to time your shots.\r\n\r\nYeah, like you\'re saying the timing is important and you have to line up your shots. That\'s a good kind of stress, where you\'re like, just keep trying to get it right. There\'s a lot [of] different weapons in the game all with different feels, so you can find the one that suits you. And we even included a few customization options as well for people who like to change their reticle colors and stuff.\r\n\r\nIn your process of remaking Resident Evil 2, I was curious, did you pull from any other inspirations for its horror--at least aside from the original?\r\n\r\nH: It\'s not direct inspiration of the content so much as an approach, but if you think of Alien, that movie introduces this enemy character. You have no idea what it is when you watch the first movie, and it has to establish what it is, what the rules are. And when you have a sequel like Aliens, you have to go in assuming people know what they\'re talking about when they say what an alien is and what it can do, and that second movie has to sort of expand the world, the universe of the movie to bring something extra to that.\r\n\r\nAnd I think with Resident Evil 1 and 2, it\'s a similar thing, where Resident Evil 1 is like the grandfather of survival horror-games. It\'s the first time most people played a game that was a horror experience, and had zombies in it, and they had to figure out what the rules of fighting a zombie are. Once you\'ve established that, like with Resident Evil 2, you have to know that\'s the new baseline. You\'re not starting from zero anymore.\r\n\r\nThe new baseline is how Resident Evil works, and then how do you expand on that? How do you bring new experiences and gameplay to that? And I think I\'ve got a similar approach to that, where you know: the stoicism of Alien, or the first Resident Evil is where the series starts, and then the second one you have to broaden your horizons a little to bring something new to the table. And we try to bring a mixture of the pure horror of the original and then bring up a new level of entertainment to the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. You can\'t do the second one that way without having establishing it properly first. Batman Begins had to be like, who Batman is in this world, this is how he operates. Everyone knows that going in, so you can kick off The Dark Knight with The Joker introduction.\r\n\r\nNo Caption Provided\r\nGallery image 1Gallery image 2Gallery image 3Gallery image 4Gallery image 5Gallery image 6Gallery image 7Gallery image 8Gallery image 9Gallery image 10\r\nBut some of the other design philosophy from those films can be applied to the Resident Evil 2 Remake as well. For example, the appearances and costumes in the game. We want to bring a certain reality to them. When you look at a character like The Joker, previous live-action iterations have been a bit more theatrical and had someone who looked like how he would from the comics, but they didn\'t answer the question of how someone would look that way in real life. In The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan portrays him as someone who has scars and puts face paint on.\r\n\r\nThere\'s this conundrum towards how to get a more realistic version of a fantastical character on screen, and we\'ve thought about that with things like how we\'d recreate the original\'s costumes for the remake. We\'d ask ourselves: what if Leon was wearing a tactical vest instead, and how would that look? We tried to add an authenticity to the designs that isn\'t completely new or different from the original game.\r\n\r\nWhen it\'s anything where you\'re building on a prequel or a sequel, a previous title, or if you\'re reimagining something that already exists, the biggest challenge for us as creators is to bring a new level of reality to things that we\'ve all seen before.\r\n\r\nIf there was another Resident Evil game that you\'d love to fully remake someday, which would you do?\r\n\r\nH: For me, that was Resident Evil 2. I want to get that over with now, because that\'s actually the one I always wanted to do. I can\'t think of remaking another game until I\'ve finished that one.\r\n\r\nKanda: I\'d almost like to imagine how would we\'d remake Resident Evil 7. It may be one of the most recent entries in the series, but it would be quite exciting and interesting to consider how we\'d redo that game.`, 4, '2018-06-24 15:56:56', 1526),
(5, 'Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey Director Talks RPG Inspirations And Story Details', 'games_assasing_creed_odyssey.jpg', 'During a visit to Ubisoft Quebec, we had the opportunity to play the upcoming Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey for about five hours. It was a small slice of the huge open world of Ancient Greece, set in 431 BC during the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. We spent that time on the Delos Islands completing side quests, leading a rebellion, and engaging in many of the RPG elements that are new to the franchise. Dialogue options aren\'t the only thing that are new, as facing the consequences of your choices was very much part of the demo. You can read about our experience in an in-depth preview of Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey and how RPG elements seem to make it a better game.\r\n\r\nIn addition to getting our hands on an early build, we had the chance to talk with Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey\'s director Scott Phillips. The following interview digs into the inspiration for the new direction, what players can expect throughout the story, and how the team is working in the rich history of this time period.\r\n\r\nFor more on Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey, be sure to check out our breakdown of the six biggest changes for this entry. If you want to see more of the game in action, we have a bunch of gameplay videos that show off ship combat, dialogue sequences, and large-scale battles.\r\n\r\nGameSpot: The first thing that struck me when playing the game is the heavier RPG elements. How was that decision made and what other games did you draw inspiration from? Where did that start?\r\n\r\nScott Phillips: It was early on, three years ago, we were coming to the end of Syndicate. When talking about what Assassin\'s Creed Odyssey should be, we asked where do we want Assassin\'s Creed to go, what does it need to evolve into? We talked with the Assassin\'s Creed Origins team to see what they were doing. We both had the same sort of idea of where the series should go--RPG choice, we wanted to push it forward. We knew Origins was doing some of those things, but for us, we had the time to really go even further to focus on the two characters, Alexios and Kassandra, to focus on choice within the stories and within the dialogue, to give you special abilities, to build your own play style.\r\n\r\nIn terms of inspiration, I play a lot of RPGs and I would say open-world is my favorite genre. The RPG is something [that] fits together super, super well. And I play everything that comes out; games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and obviously Assassin\'s Creed Origins. The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Fallout, those two are probably some of my favorite[s]. And if you look at those games, they give players a lot of options. For us, that was what we wanted to push Assassin\'s Creed as a franchise into: more choice for the player.\r\n\r\nThis is the first Assassin\'s Creed that\'s moved into branching dialogue and consequences for your choices. In the playable demo, decisions were made, side quests were completed, and two hours down the line, the consequences play out. The end product of the decision wasn\'t clear right away. How hard is it to keep it cohesive?\r\n\r\nIt\'s super hard, I\'ve got to say. There\'s no other way to put it. We try to think of every consequence that can happen. We write all those, we move forward with structuring the quests and all of the quests that could be impacted in a way that\'ll work. Then we play it a lot and ask ourselves, what did we miss? What doesn\'t connect? What doesn\'t pay off well enough?\r\n\r\nSomething we had a while ago and tried was including a sort of the Telltale-style \"your choice will have an impact\" notification afterward. Ultimately we felt that the player is better off making those connections themselves and we didn\'t want to put too much in their face. We wanted the feeling of, \"Oh, wow, that thing I did back then...\" or when they talk to someone else and say, \"Oh, I had no idea that those connections were made.\" We felt after play tests that it was the stronger way to go rather than being in the player\'s face with the decisions being made.\r\n\r\nMale protagonist Alexios speaking with Socrates, one of the many ways Odyssey incorporates Greek history.\r\nMale protagonist Alexios speaking with Socrates, one of the many ways Odyssey incorporates Greek history.\r\nAssassin\'s Creed always told a contained story within history. But choices seem to play out in the larger, main narrative. Is there going to be bigger payoffs or consequences of larger scale, maybe multiple endings? How much can you change the world and how much will it be reflected in the world as the game goes on?\r\n\r\nWe have to make decisions about how big are we going to go with certain choices. Obviously, we want some to have massive changes to the story, but we have mid-scale changes and small changes. Some parts of side quests can impact the main quest: who appears, who\'s around you, who\'s dead, who\'s alive, who you\'re friends with, who hates you. Those sorts of things all sort of feed into both the main story, and all of the side stories, and in the world itself because the world is constantly changing. The mercenaries that are alive in your playthrough, I may never see in mine or maybe I killed them in my playthrough. The leaders can also be different. So, there\'s a lot of activity and change and when players talk to each other about what their experience was, or some great fight they had with this mercenary, or the choice they made in that quest, it\'s going to be a very different experience for each player.\r\n\r\nI love the Mass Effect series, but with Paragon/Renegade, I know straight up if my decision is good or bad. But we\'ve also had games like The Witcher 3 that just give you options, and who knows how they\'ll pay off in the end. From the slice we played, it seems Odyssey is going the latter route.\r\n\r\nMaking the game morally gray and not black-and-white was important to us. We didn\'t want it to be like past games where you\'re not forced to not kill civilians, as a simple example. The Creed doesn\'t exist for your player character in terms of restricting you from doing that. That\'s your choice. But we\'re going to impact the player, we\'re going to show you that it means something in the game world. And it\'s going to give you feedback, you\'re going to feel those choices you\'ve made in small-scale and in these large-scale choices across the game.\r\n\r\nDo you want to encourage players to do more side stuff, especially those who tend to mainline games? Do you kind of accept that they might be missing out on some really good story bits and narrative arcs?\r\n\r\nYeah, I think the easiest example is if you look at our E3 demo, you don\'t have to play any of that. That\'s all side content in the main game, and that\'s true throughout huge parts of the game. We want you to do that, we think you will enjoy it. And as balance between players that want to rush the game and players that want to complete every single piece is a challenge for us, because we want both play styles to be valid and work well. In an RPG, making sure that the player who does 100% of the content and that player who does only what they want, we want both to have a good experience. Balance for both player types is something that RPGs have struggled with quite a bit. I think we have a very good progression system, a very good way of balancing the game that makes it so everyone, no matter what they do, is going to have a great time.\r\n\r\nCharacter relationships are a new thing, along with choice-based dialogue, of course. For example, I tried romancing Kyra but it didn\'t work out. How deep are relationships going to go and how impactful are those relationships?\r\n\r\nIt depends on the character. I would say Kyra is a mid-level romance to put it in a weird way. There are some side characters, and other characters where it\'s a shorter thing, but you can still recruit people to be on your ship crew. And with some of these romanceable characters, you can recruit them to be on your ship and with you for the rest of your journey, or you can never see them again. It\'s sort of your choice. There\'s also family relationships which you\'ll make decisions about, and will impact, ultimately, who\'s around or who\'s there for help as you get further in the game. You\'ll see a lot of variation based on the way you\'ve played the game.\r\n\r\nWith choice-based dialogue, there are many directions it can go. But it\'s all contained in Greek mythology and the Ancient Greek historical time period. How do you balance between using history and creative freedom? Are we still going to have that rich, historical backdrop along with the story that you\'re trying to tell as well?\r\n\r\nIt\'s fun. It\'s always a back-and-forth of how far can we push it: when do we need to focus more on Greek history, when do we need to focus more on Assassin\'s Creed lore, and when do we need to just give the player something really cool to do? We\'re constantly making those choices. On a small scale, it\'s things like how buildings and structures look. We maintain historical accuracy, but some of our statues are way bigger than they would\'ve been in this time period. Or the look of Sparta in our game is more grandiose than what Sparta actually was, because the Spartans, the Laconians, were very minimalistic. They focused solely on war; they didn\'t try to build big statues. But we wanted Sparta to be this awesome, amazing, epic-looking Greek location, and we had to push it forward.\r\n\r\nSkyrim, Fallout, those two are probably some of my favorite[s]. And if you look at those games, they give players a lot of options. For us, that was what we wanted to push Assassin\'s Creed as a franchise into: more choice for the player.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to ships, there are simple things about how the triremes would have to be pulled out of the water to avoid getting waterlogged and sinking. Obviously, we\'re not going to do that. But we also need to make decisions about ramming, shooting javelins, and firing arrows; how far are we going to push it? Did they have catapults? Did catapults exist at that time? Well, sort of. It\'s always a fine line, and we\'re pushing and pulling, and trying to make sure that we\'re true to both the vision we want to have for a game in 2018 and what this period of time would\'ve looked like.\r\n\r\nWhen you meet with Socrates, you have discussions of philosophy. You meet with Hippocrates, who\'s the father of medicine. You talk to Herodotus, who\'s the father of modern history. You engage with these characters and develop details about what their thought processes were, and you affect it as well. But then you also argue with Socrates even as you have him as an ally. So, it\'s a constant battle between too little and too much. And I think we found a really good balance, especially with the mythology of Ancient Greece. It\'s a super deep, awesome mythology of legends and gods with the mixture of history. And it\'s also Assassin\'s Creed, which has a ton of characters with names from the first civilization that come from Ancient Greece, and they\'re coming from that sort of lore. We had a good backdrop to sort of mix the two. I don\'t want to spoil stuff, but there are a lot of really cool ways that pays off. If you really engage in the game, there\'s some really amazing stuff that ties it all together.\r\n\r\nAs for the modern day storyline, are any of the RPG elements going to play into the modern day storytelling?\r\n\r\nSo, there is definitely modern day gameplay with Layla Hassan, but I don\'t want to go into that just yet.\r\n\r\nOrigins was big in terms of scope, and this game seems big, too. How do you answer those worried about series fatigue? Even though there\'s a lot of new stuff, they might just not be in the mood for another huge open world.\r\n\r\nWe\'ve worked on the game for three years, and in terms of what we\'ve done, we put in a huge amount of effort. We had a big team for that period of time. We focused on making this huge, huge game. I think fans will really see, when they play it, that what we brought is something new and fresh to Assassin\'s Creed with choice, with RPG elements. And I think it is and will be one of the favorite Assassin\'s Creed games.', 4, '2018-06-24 16:05:10', 986),

The loss eliminated Panama and Tunisia, while putting Belgium into the round of 16.\r\n\r\nKane’s three goals moved him into the lead with five at this year’s tournament, one more than Cristiano Ronaldo and Romelu Lukaku after two games.\r\n\r\nJohn Stones headed in two goals and Jesse Lingard curled in another to ensure England goes into its Group G finale against Belgium level on points and with the same goal difference.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland forward Harry Kane (C) scores the team’s sixth goal during the Russia 2018 World Cup Group G football match between England and Panama at the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium in Nizhny Novgorod on June 24, 2018. JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/GETTY IMAGES\r\n\r\nIn Russia, England has been trying to cast aside the negativity of the past while remoulding the image of the team on and off the field. Even locals were supporting the team in Nizhny Novgorod, despite the bitter diplomatic relations between Russia and Britain.\r\n\r\nThe egos who dominated in England’s celebrity-obsessed, underperforming Golden Generation in the first decade of century have gone. The joy and togetherness in the squad — the second-youngest in Russia — becomes clear in the goal celebrations.\r\n\r\nWhere past England teams might have wilted in warm temperatures, this one pressed with high-tempo intensity to ensure there was no need to scrape a victory like on Monday against Tunisia.\r\n\r\nEngland picked up where it left off in Volgograd, with a corner from Kieran Trippier headed into the net in the eighth minute. It wasn’t Kane on the end this time but Stones, who was left unmarked to score his first international goal.\r\n\r\nKane didn’t have to wait long to add to his tally, converting from the penalty spot in the 22nd after Lingard was brought down by Fidel Escobar.\r\n\r\nLingard did get on the scoresheet in the 36th with the pick of the goals. The Manchester United forward played a 1-2 with Ashley Young and exchanged passes with Raheem Sterling before shifting the ball across and bending it into the top corner.\r\n\r\n\r\nRuben Loftus-Cheek of England takes a shot during the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia group G match between England and Panama at Nizhny Novgorod Stadium on June 24, 2018 in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. JAN KRUGER/GETTY IMAGES\r\n\r\nThe fourth goal was the culmination of a well-worked free kick with Sterling’s close-range header parried by goalkeeper Jaime Penedo. Stones was primed to follow-up, giving the defender his second.\r\n\r\nHowever much they tried, Panama struggled to block England’s route to goal. Anibal Gody resorted to trying to wrestle Kane to the ground, only to concede a penalty that was converted by the Tottenham striker.\r\n\r\nEngland was merciless. At 5-0, the job was complete by halftime.\r\n\r\nChasing the golden boot, Kane relied on his heel to complete his hat trick by getting the faintest of touches to divert Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s shot into the net.\r\n\r\nEngland could afford to ease up and preserve energy but it cost the team first place on goal difference. Felipe Baloy slid to meet Ricardo Avila’s free kick and score Panama’s first World Cup goal.\r\n\r\nPanama, beaten by Belgium 3-0 in the opening game, finally had something to celebrate, briefly.\r\n\r\nKEY TO SUCCESS\r\n\r\nEngland had spells of sloppy defending that could be punished by stronger teams, like Belgium. But by taking their chances and exploiting a porous defence, England showed what it is capable of.\r\n\r\nGROUP DYNAMICS\r\n\r\nThe winner of the England-Belgium match on Thursday in Kaliningrad will win Group G. In the event of a draw, it could come down to which team has fewer yellow cards.', 6, '2018-06-24 16:23:23', 2),
